# Time Series

**Time series data** means that data is in a series of  particular time periods or intervals. **Time series analysis** is a statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis.

Time series data is data that is collected at different points in time. This is opposed to **cross-sectional data** which observes individuals, companies, etc. at a single point in time. Because data points in time series are collected at adjacent time periods there is ***potential for correlation between observations***. This is one of the features that distinguishes time series data from cross-sectional data.

# Forecasting

**Forecasting** is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends. The longer the forecast reaches in the future, the more inaccurate it gets.
